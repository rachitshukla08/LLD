There are some stock exchanges like zerodha, nse which are continuously releasing some updates

eg: Price of a stock is 200

There are some subscribers who consume these updates

Many to Many relationship is there bw publisher and subscriber

We may be receiving diff prices from every publisher for a stock value because of old data being published by
some publisher
So to solve this, the publisher also sends a version number along with price to choose the publisher with the
latest version of stock price
