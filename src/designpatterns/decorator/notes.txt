we are designing dominos pizza
We need to create diff varities of pizza and computes cost based on ingredients

There is a base, topping1, topping2, topping3
Even if we put one more topping on it, eg mushroom then it will still be  a pizza
Base can be off different varieties but there will be a single base in a pizza
eg wheat, thin crust, cheese burst.

Combinations of base and toppings will result in a type of pizza
Pizza = base || pizza = pizza + topping

Pizza p = new WheatBase();
Pizza p1 = new Onion(p);
Pizza p2 = new Mushroom(p1);

=> new Mushroom(new Onion(new WheatBase())) this is also a pizza
This style is called as decoration
Here all the subtypes are coded against pizza hence they all return a pizza

But there is some kind of logical difference between topping and pizza. so we can introduce one more intermediate
abstract class topping to logically separate base and topping but ultimately it is subtype of pizza

A base does not need a pizza but any topping needs a pizza to be put on.
