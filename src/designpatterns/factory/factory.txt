Cons of usage of new keyword

- Class starts to depend on concrete implementations hence violates dependency inversion principle
- When code starts to depend on concretions we lose flexibility

How to get rid of it?
- We can do dependency injection by client instead of creating my own object in class

We need to defer the usage of new keyword as long as possible and move it up to high level classes


With factory:
Creation responsibility is centralised
We no longer have to depend on lot of concrete classes in coffeeserver

USE CASES:
There are different types of my product
Type1, Type2, Type3
Type1 is tied to a specific combination of ingredients
Type2 is tied to a another combination of ingredients
etc

In this case abstract factory is useful

Cons of factory pattern:
Gives birth to lot of small classes (But it is still better than keeping bulky classes)
If we add some new ingredient eg: spice then our interface and all the dependent classes will change
