Design for discussion forum of PPA
Students while asking doubts should be able to add tags to their query
We want to create a system that allows to manipulate these tags
eg: Delete tags, Delete tags whose name matches a pattern, Add new tag, Update tag

Suppose there are tags Math, Maths, Mathematics. All these are same so we should have an operation that
merges these tags with a common name

Create an Application to support:
-Insert new tag
-Deletion of all tags with name
-Deletion of tags with regex
-Updation of tag


Notes:
All the implementations of command should have simple code in execute()
There should be a Receiver which actually knows and contains logic to perform the complex logic like
deletion based on match
