Design a single elevator for a residential building

Req:
-On every floor there should be a button which gives an indication to the elevator to stop at that
floor
-Inside there elevator there should be buttons like G, 1,2 etc to denote floors
-Open and close gate buttons from inside
-Do not allow all sorts of operations all the time
eg: when elevator is moving, opening gate is not allowed
elevator is at a floor with door opened then we cannot go to another floor until the door is closed

There are 2 categories of requests:
Upward
Downward

suppose elevtor is moving up and it receives some more request for floors above it and some for
 below it then it should first serve all the requests from the floors above only then it should start
 moving down and serve downward requests.

The movement is unidirectional. Elevator should serve all the requests in a particular direction before
changing its direction to serve other requests.

In the future is strategy may change.
