There is a single database with multiple tables.

Table: Composed of multiple rows and columns
Columns: Only contains strings
we need to store integers, floats etc in form of strings

It should be allowed to add/ delete rows from table

I should be able to create and delete tables

It should be possible to add/remove columns from a table

Tables should also have constraints: PK, FK

We want to allow selecting and updating of rows from certain table based on certain criterias
EG: Filter person whose age > 30 and blood group is B+ve
