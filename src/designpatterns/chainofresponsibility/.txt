There is a system where there are interceptors
eg Validation, authentication, authorization

Before a req we need to perform these checks

We can have a List<RequestHandler> in the usinginterface package
-but here our sequence of handling is fixed but what if the sequence of handling is required in a
different order eg H2 then H1 then H3
-also the handlers cannot communicate with each other. suppose the next handler relies on response of previous
handler h1 -> h2(uses result of h1) -> h3 (uses result of h2)
