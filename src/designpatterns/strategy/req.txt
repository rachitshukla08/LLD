There should be a number store where I can add and search numbers
We should be able to insert data in user ordered manner
We should be able to search data on user provided algorithm

For now
suppose for insert there are 2 algorithms - ordered, unordered
For search there are 2 algorithms -linear, binary

Design a class where user can pick their algorithms in any combination of above 2

Strategy pattern:
When we wish to have different types for something and ensure all the types behave differently
for same function call
